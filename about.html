                The Malabar Gold Company was established in the year 1993. It has over 260 showrooms across the world currently and the number of outlets.
                The Malabar Group has been on an expansion since 2000 and more showrooms are expected to be opened in India, Southeast Asia, 
                the Middle East, and in the United States. The brand is mainly committed to India, the Gulf and Far East markets. 

                On 12 January 2018, the company opened 11 outlets in a single day across the globe setting a new record. 
                The number of outlets reached 208 with this launch. Out of the 11 outlets opened, 8 were located in the Gulf region. 
                The new showrooms were established in AL-Hazana Lulu, Al-Khail Mall, Al- Buhaira Lulu, Ajman City Centre and Sahara Centre in the UAE, 
                Lagoona Mall and Mall of Qatar in Qatar,AMK Hub in Singapore, Muscat City Centre in Oman, Warrangal in Telangana, and in Ampang Mall in Malaysia. 
                
                It took the company around 25 years to open 215 outlets across 9 countries of the world. Out of all the countries,
                India is where it has the highest number of outlets and the Indian market accounts for about a third of the companys revenue. 
                The first brand ambassadors of Malabar Gold were tennis star Sania Mirza and Malayalam actor Mohanlal. 
                In November 2018, Malabar Gold & Diamonds made its entry into the U.S. market with an outlet in Chicago that was inaugurated by Neeta Bhushan, 
                Counsel General of India. This was the 250th outlet of the group. 
                
                Malabar Gold & Diamonds legally converted its UAE operations covering Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman into 100% ownership.
